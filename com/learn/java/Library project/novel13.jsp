<p>Laura Miller felt that Adiga comes closer than most in becoming a dickensian. She wrote: "His characters are brightly and sharply drawn and animated with great energy; reading about his Mumbai is like taking a double shot of espresso."[3] Elizabeth Kuruvilla of Mint wrote: "Adiga’s novel oscillates between lyrically exposing what the brutal system in the business of creating sporting heroes does to the minds, and lives, of vulnerable youth and an amateurish filling in of gaps with monologue and characters that are inadequately fleshed out."[4] Jade Colbert of The Globe and Mail said that "[It] is not a novel you read to find consolation from the melancholy realities of the world's injustices, but to know them, and feel Manju's scorn."[5] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times called it "mixes incisive stroke play with streaky shots." He further wrote: "Adiga’s prose has a bustling energy that makes it highly readable but also reduces characters to certain cartoonish traits, such as the slanted furrow in Manju’s forehead that appears whenever he thinks deeply, or the “rakishly” raised right eyebrow that signals his father's outbreaks of anger."</p>
